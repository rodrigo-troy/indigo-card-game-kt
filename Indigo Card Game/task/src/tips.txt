What is the game finish condition?
when no cards are in the cardsdeck  + no cards are in hand for both human + comp

When a player wins the cards on the table, how should I calculate his/her/computer scores?
Add one score for each A, 10, J, Q, K card (other cards cost zero) from the table.
A card that was used to win everthing on table counts also!

When to add 3 extra scores (according the rules) to a player?
when the end of the game is reached

At the end of a game, when all score calculations are perfomed, you can see some cards
remain on the table (if any). Just add them to last a card winner pocket or first player(according the rules). YOu don't need to calculate their scores, just show statistics like this:
Score: Player 12 - Computer X
Cards: Player 40 - Computer X

Do not show statisitcs if a user typed "exit", just print Game Over


I handle the endgame functionality like this...
1) print out the string for cards on the table
2) give the last player to win cards (or first player to move if null) the cards and points from the table
3) if cards won is equal to both players give +3 to first player to move else +3 points to player with most cards
4) print the score
